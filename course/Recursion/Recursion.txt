-same operation is multiple times with different inputs
-in every step we make the problem smaller
-we mandatorily have to tell the base condition to stop the process


Example BST:
-Lets say we are searching for a node
search(node){
if node==null then return
else

if(currentNode== searchNode)
return true;
else if(currentNode < SearchNode)
search(currentNode->right);
else
search(currentNode->left);
}
}


-Trees and graphs heavily uses the recursion
-Greddy,Dynamic programming and divide and conquer use the recursion strategy.


Format of the recursive function:
1. recursive case - case where the function occurs
2. base case - case where the function doesn't occur

RecursiveFunction(node)
{
if(Base_condition)
ignore
else
RecursiveFunction(nodex);
}
